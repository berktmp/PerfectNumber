# PerfectNumber
In this program, the user is prompted to enter a number. The program then calculates the sum of all the proper divisors of the number (excluding the number itself) by iterating from 1 to number-1. A proper divisor is a positive integer that divides the number without leaving a remainder.

After calculating the sum of divisors, the program checks if the sum is equal to the entered number. If they are equal, it means the number is a perfect number, and the program displays the message "is a perfect number." If the sum is not equal to the number, it means the number is not a perfect number, and the program displays the message "is not a perfect number."

Note that this program assumes that the entered number is a positive integer greater than 1. You can add input validation code to handle other cases if needed.
